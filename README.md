**Project Title: MeraMarket – The Smart Local Helper App**

**🌍 Overview**_
MeraMarket is a full-stack web application designed to make local shopping, daily essentials, and urgent help services easily accessible for everyone — from travellers and students to newly shifted residents and local buyers.
It connects local shopkeepers, service providers, and users on a single platform — creating a digital local marketplace where people can discover shops, get product availability info, find nearby food, and even request help during emergencies.
Whether someone is new in the city, travelling, or just exploring nearby markets, MeraMarket acts as their digital market companion.

**⚡ Problem Statement**

People new to a city often don’t know which shops are best or nearby.
Travellers and students face difficulty finding daily essentials quickly.
Local markets remain offline and miss out on visibility.
In busy areas, people struggle to locate ATMs, petrol pumps, or good food.
During urgent moments (e.g., “cash finished”, “need help”, etc.), no single app helps connect with others nearby.
MeraMarket solves these problems with one integrated platform.

**💡 Objectives****

Help users find best-rated shops and essentials nearby.
Connect local sellers and buyers digitally.
Allow travellers and students to access local facilities easily.
Support real-time chat and help requests between users.
Suggest food and service options based on current location.
